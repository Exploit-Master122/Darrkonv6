***HOW TO ALT+TAB WHEN PANIC BUTTON DOES NOT WORK:***
- First,close all your tabs. (Except this)
- Open two new windows.
- Press Control+n to open a new window.(Press twice)
- In that window,go to an educational website,or whatever website you need to be on.
- Check if your other window is running in the background.
- Go to the website that you WANT to be on,in the proxy.
- Press Alt,(Hold it down for 2 seconds) And Press Tab (Switches windows quickly)
- That is a tester.
- Press Alt and Tab as fast as you can,as a smooth switch between two windows!
- The perfect solution,almost better than a panic button!
